#### AOA World!
Pakistan is going through one of the worst monsoon rains and flash floods, causing massive destructions, damages to infrastructure, and directly affecting millions of
people across the country. Till now, an estimated 33 to 35 million people have been directly affected by the floods while over 1300 people have already died till now.
The unprecedented floods have not only caused serious damage and destruction, they have also left thousands with illness and millions more vulnerable to various
diseases. With the winter incoming, the homeless people will be totally helpless.

That's why we have created this Dapp, so anyone from anywhere in the world can donate as low as $5. All the donations will be given to trusted foundations like
Al-Khidmat & JDC.
